# Nginx Debug module

## Background

Nginx is a widely used web server. However, when a web application become 
complicated, it is a nightmare to maintain the Nginx configuration. For example:
1. It is hard find the location a certain request matched within hundreds of 
   locations, which will lead to mis-configured the Nginx conf and make your
   service down.
2. It is hard to make sure your rewrite rules are well written.
