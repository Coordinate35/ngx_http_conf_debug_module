# ngx_http_conf_debug_module

The ngx_http_conf_debug_module module is used for debug nginx configuration.

In debug mode, module will add the config infomation in a Nginx variable when
a request incoming, which will affect the request processing.

In interrupt mode, module will intercept the request to prevent it from being
proxy_pass to upstream server(because we just want to test the config).Simultaneous limitation of access by address and by password is controlled by the satisfy directive

**Attention**:
1. In location scene:
   1. ~ and ~* 's accuracy rely on macro NGX_HTTP_CASELESS_FILESYSTEM hasn't defined
   2. Nested location and @named location is not support

## Example configuration

```

http {
    conf_debug_enable on;
    conf_debug_interrupt on;
    conf_debug_interrupt_code 406;
}

```
